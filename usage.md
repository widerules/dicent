# Usage #

## Player selection screen ##
On the Player selection screen you can select who rolls the dice. The point of this is that Dicent remembers which dice each player selected in the last roll because the heroes usually don't change equipment that often and therefore often roll the same dice. The dice aren't remembered for the Overlord however, since they usually have to change dice pretty often.

You can also change the player names by long-clicking them.

## Select Dice ##
Here you can select which dice to roll. If you play with Road to Legend, Sea of Blood or Tomb of Ice, make sure to enable the addons (menu button > preferences) to be able to use Silver/Gold and/or Transparent dice.

## Results ##
The Results screen shows what you rolled. On the bottom you can see the results so you don't have to count the wounds, surges, etc. yourself. "Enhancement" are the sides on the Black/Silver/Gold die where you can choose either range or wounds.

To reroll, just lice in the select dice screen, select which dice to reroll and press the reroll button.

You can also add Black (and Silver/Gold if Road to Legend is enabled) die (when spending fatigue in the game).

## Persistent Storage ##
Player names, selected dice and preferences are stored even if you close the application. You can reset these things to their defaults by using the reset button in preferences.
